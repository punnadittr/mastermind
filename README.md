Mastermind for The Odin Project

Instructions

1. Run 'ruby mastermind.rb' to play
2. Choose whether to guess code or to make code
3. Always enter code in '1 2 3 4' format (without quote)
4. The code consists of only [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (no 0 or 7)
5. The numbers can be duplicated in code (ex 5 5 5 5 or 1 1 1 4)
6. You have 12 rounds to guess (the computer will never reach round 12)

If you are the code maker, the computer will always win with an average of 7 turns.

This is the most complicated program I have ever made (from my 2 months learning period).
